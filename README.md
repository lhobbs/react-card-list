## Hellosaurus Frontend Assignment

### Background

Thanks for your interest in a role at Hellosaurus! We're excited to learn more about you and your technical style.

The first step in our process is a quick coding challenge where we'll ask you to implement a feature in React. We recommend spending roughly 45 minutes on this.

To run your application using repl.it, simply hit the big green "Run" button at the top of the screen. A web view will open up on the right, which you can also open in a new tab for easier viewing. If you'd like to install any new packages, you can do so by clicking on the "Packages" icon in the far left sidebar.

If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to email [jared@hellosaurus.com](mailto:jared@hellosaurus.com). We're looking forward to seeing your solution!

### Assignment Overview

Hellosaurus works with award-winning kids media creators to produce content for our platform. To share these creators with the world, we'd like to add a page on our Marketing App that shows a searchable list of them.

### Requirements

* Make a request to our [creator endpoint](https://api.hellosaurus.com/marketing/creators) to load the full list of public Hellosaurus creators.
* For each creator, display a card with their avatar and title. Ideally, we'd like to be able to use the same card in other places throughout the site.
* Because we expect to have a lot of creators, please also add a search bar that filters them.
* We expect a lot of our users to be on mobile devices, so performance and mobile-responsiveness matter a lot.
* We want to execute quickly and get a v0 out before our design team has the bandwidth to take a pass, so please ensure the result looks presentable and makes for a good user experience.
* Since this is the first of many iterations for this page, the maintainability of your solution matters a lot. Try to follow established patterns and be intentional about making any structural improvements.
